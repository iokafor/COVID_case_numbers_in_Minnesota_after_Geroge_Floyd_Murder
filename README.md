# Does Protesting Correlate with COVID Spikes?
After the murder of George Floyd on May 25th 2020 in Minnesota, many people took to the streets to protest. Unfortunately this tradegy happened in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. **Therefore it is reasonable to ask if these protests caused an increase in COVID cases** _industry question_. To answer this question, I pulled the daily report of COVID cases throughout the US from the JHU Covid Dashboard github page. Then I filtered the data for Minnesota, calculated a Confirmed cases to # of people tested ratio. After that I plotted the ratio vs time and also the incident rate vs time.

I found conflicting data depending on the metric I used (incident rate or ratio of confirmed to tested). According to the ratio of confirmed to tested, after the protests there were lower confirmed cases per tested individual. However the incident rate went up from 460 to 560, suggesting things got worse.
