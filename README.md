# Metro areas with Black population growth
I wondered what US metro areas have the highest growth in black population. To do this I downloaded Census data from 2019 and 2018. I kept only the "race" column and population column. I kept the GEONAME, PRF_ESTIMATE and TITLE columns. I kept the row if the TITLE column was "Black or African American". That left me with metro areas, their african american population. I then merged the 2018 and the 2019 data, and calculated percent change. I then plotted percent change for the top 10 by metro area after sorting the data.
